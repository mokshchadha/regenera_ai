  `Chapter-by-Chapter Summary: "Is Natural Capital a Material Issue?"
Report Overview: A 2012 study by ACCA, Fauna & Flora International, and KPMG examining whether biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES) represent material business issues requiring accounting professional attention and corporate disclosure.
Executive Summary
The report investigates materiality concepts regarding natural capital, focusing on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Key findings show variable perceptions within the accountancy profession, with some companies including BES in risk evaluations while others overlook these issues due to focus on financial measurement for materiality determination. The study included 200+ ACCA member surveys, 8 CFO interviews, and disclosure analysis of 40 companies across high-risk sectors.
Key Statistics:

60% of ACCA respondents agreed natural world was important to their business
49% identified natural capital as material business issue
Only 18 of largest 100 companies mentioned biodiversity in annual reports
50% of company earnings could be at risk from environmental externalities (equivalent to 11% global GDP)

Chapter 1: Introduction
Research Methodology:

Semi-structured interviews with 8 CFOs/senior managers
ACCA membership survey (200+ responses)
Disclosure review of 40 companies across forestry, food production, utilities, construction
Expert panel guidance from industry, academia, accountancy profession

Report Structure: 7 chapters covering natural capital links to BES, business risk, materiality concepts, reporting practices, valuation methodologies, and recommendations.
Chapter 2: Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services and Corporate Performance
Key Definitions:

Natural Capital: Stock of capital from natural resources (biological diversity, ecosystems, geological resources)
Biodiversity: Variability among living organisms at species, habitat, genetic levels
Ecosystem Services: Benefits humans obtain from ecosystems (provisioning, regulating, cultural, supporting services)
Biodiversity Offset: Measurable conservation outcomes compensating for adverse biodiversity impacts

Critical Statistics:

Two-thirds of BES on which society/business relies are degraded or declining
Cumulative losses 2000-2050 equivalent to 7% GDP by 2050
Loss of UK bee pollination services would cost Â£1.8 billion annually
30% of UK's ecosystem services degraded or in decline

Business Dependencies: Companies depend on ecosystem services for raw materials, stable operating environment, while having potential positive/negative impacts through activities affecting corporate value via asset values and profit margins.
Chapter 3: Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services as Business Risk and Opportunity
Risk Categories:

Operational: Scarcity/quality of raw materials, reduced productivity, supply chain disruption
Regulatory/Legal: Land access restrictions, litigation, resource quotas, compensation mechanisms
Reputational: Brand damage, license to operate issues
Market/Products: Consumer preference changes, purchaser requirements
Financing: Increased capital costs, lending requirement failures

Sector Risk Analysis: Table showing 13 sectors (mining, oil/gas, agriculture, forestry, utilities, construction, etc.) mapped against risk types and ecosystem service dependencies. High-risk sectors face multiple risk categories across all ecosystem service types.
Barriers to Action:

Low awareness of ecosystem services (70% ACCA members needed training)
Skills gaps in understanding ES-business performance links
Inherent valuation challenges
Competitiveness concerns
Lack of standardized metrics
Potential increased risk exposure from measurement

Chapter 4: Are Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Issues Material?
Materiality Definition: Issues that could influence users of financial accounts (shareholders, investors, lenders). Traditional financial materiality focuses on short-term financial impact, while sustainability materiality includes broader stakeholder impacts over longer periods.
Natural Capital Materiality Challenges:

BES rarely represents direct business costs unless specific production inputs
Often affects wider society as environmental externalities
Low/uncalculated market values
Economic impacts often small or future-oriented
82% of risks in company assessments are short-medium term (up to 5 years)

Examples of Material BES Issues:

Infinito Gold: Lost 50% share value when Costa Rica annulled mining concession due to environmental concerns
BP Gulf Spill: $3.5 billion clean-up provision, $7.8 billion litigation provision in 2011 accounts
Newmont Peru: $150 million investment required to address water availability concerns

Growing Investor Interest:

354 investors with $43 trillion assets supported CDP Water Disclosure
39 financial institutions committed to integrating natural capital at Rio+20
Natural Capital Declaration endorsed by 40+ private sector organizations

Chapter 5: Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in Reporting
Reporting Drivers:

Internal: operational decisions, financial valuations, capital expenditure
External: stakeholder communication, reputation, market differentiation, regulatory compliance

Regulatory Requirements:

Mandatory: Limited laws requiring BES disclosure, though general environmental reporting required in UK Company Law 2006, EU Modernisation Directive
France NRE Law 2001: Requires quoted companies disclose biodiversity impacts, resource consumption
Denmark Financial Statements Act: Large companies report societal responsibility

Voluntary Frameworks:

Global Reporting Initiative (3,900 companies using GRI-guided reports)
AA1000 Series, ISAE 3000
Sector-specific guidance for mining, oil/gas, food/drink, cement

Disclosure Survey Results (40 companies across 4 high-risk sectors):

75% reported some BES issues, mostly limited to water consumption
17 companies conducted materiality analysis
Just over half integrated BES into materiality evaluation
Significant variation between sectors despite similar risk profiles

Reporting Barriers:

Perceived immateriality
Lack of awareness/understanding
Absence of disclosure guidelines and valuation methodologies
Perceived lack of stakeholder demand
Credibility concerns about judgment-based statements

Chapter 6: Valuing Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services
Current Valuation Approaches:
Most BES elements not traded in markets, requiring economic analysis techniques:

Revealed Preference: Based on existing market observations (e.g., house prices near natural areas)
Cost-Based: Replacement costs or damage costs avoided (e.g., wetland vs. flood defense costs)
Stated Preference: Survey-based willingness-to-pay for hypothetical changes
Value Transfer: Applying economic values from one context to another with adjustments

Total Economic Value Framework:

Use Values: Direct (consumable outputs), Indirect (ecological services), Option (future use premium)
Non-Use Values: Existence, altruistic, bequest values (intrinsic value regardless of use)

Business Applications:

Rio Tinto Madagascar: $17.3 million net economic benefits from forest conservation offset project
Eni Ecuador: "Invisible pipeline" design saved 15,000 trees in high biodiversity area
UK Water Industry: Stated preference surveys for customer willingness-to-pay for service improvements
Puma Environmental P&L: â‚¬94.4 million environmental impact valuation (92% in supply chain)

Financial Accounting Integration:
Limited current inclusion in financial accounts due to:

Boundary issues (impacts beyond company control)
Difficulty apportioning benefits to individual companies
No ownership rights for many BES elements
Competitive advantage concerns
Fiduciary duty constraints

Future Trends:

Growth of BES valuation and market mechanisms
Emerging integrated/mandatory sustainability reporting
National ecosystem accounting developments (WAVES project)
Government moves toward green economy market mechanisms

Chapter 7: Conclusions and Recommendations
Key Findings Summary:

Variable BES risk perceptions within accountancy profession
Limited corporate disclosure providing inadequate risk management insights
Existing financial standards applicable to BES but rarely utilized
Companies exploring valuation techniques for decision-making
Multiple barriers impeding effective risk/opportunity determination

Five Key Themes for Action:

Engage with experts and develop skills
Identify externalities to internalize BES impacts
Define materiality to capture all BES risks/opportunities
Consider valuation methods when appropriate
Enhance natural capital disclosures

Recommendations for CFOs:

Engage experts to understand organizational natural capital dependencies
Ensure risk/materiality assessments consider natural capital
Develop finance team skills for impact/dependency assessment
Disclose material natural capital impacts with robust assurance
Use board position to educate on BES importance in strategic decisions
Consider natural capital incorporation in financial accounts
Engage with standard setters and tool developers
Learn from companies already addressing these issues

Recommendations for Accountants:

Apply core accounting skills to natural capital methodology development
Request guidance from accountancy bodies on natural capital reporting
Track emerging guidance in natural capital area
Engage experts for skills development through training
Pilot natural capital accounting methodologies with clients
Work with regulators on disclosure guidance and assurance practices

Urgent Action Required: The challenge is determining when natural capital loss requires enhanced business risk assessment and corporate disclosure approaches. Acting too late may lead to failure in anticipating future risks and their costs, while missing opportunities for supply chain resilience, license to operate maintenance, and new market entry.
